MESSY FIRST PROJECT WITH MAVEN
===============================

AKA Crappy Word Ladders
-------------------------------

Being that I've never used maven professionally due to using internal build systems that handle managing dependencies or crazy rubyish languages, I figured I should figure this out. You know, I might actually want to write some java in my spare time.

BTW, you probably DON'T want to use this as your solution to word ladders.

Here is What I did
---------------------------------

Followed the instructions here to generate a project, build, and package it:

https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/

- Generate a project: mvn generate (with command line args)
- Build it: mvn compile
- Package it: mvn package
- Run it: mvn exec:java
